This repo contains a collection of multiple toy-examples that I have played with when learning zk.
Among them are:
- Example circuit of the poseidon hash for plonk(kzg) in halo2
- Example Merkle trees in plonky3
- Own implementation of KZG and Sumcheck protocols with arkworks
- Ecdsa signature verification with risc0 (Old  `v0.21.0`)
